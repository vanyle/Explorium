# Explorium 2
Explorium is a 2d RPG where everything is proceduraly generated.
The idea is to create a game with no assets nor ressources files.

Explorium 2 is coded in Java with the native library.

The game is in really early alpha and everything is subject to change. The current version does not represent the final game

Compiled versions and changelog are available in [build](/build).

The source code is in [src](/src).
